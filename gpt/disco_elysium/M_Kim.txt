I'm sorry the fundamental laws of the universe don't seem to agree with you, detective, but the fact remains that it's too dark to see in here without the flashlight...
Yes,.You might even call it a *feature* of the universe, that you need to *hold* tools to *use* them.
And the flashlight works a lot better if you *hold it in your hand*.
I suppose you could be impersonating him. You could have gotten the insignia from the black market or forged it. But for now I am going to set those possibilities aside. I'm not from the Inspectorate General.
I was to meet a detective from Precinct 41 at the Whirling-in-Rags who arrived here three days ago. I am told that that is how long you have been here. Besides, you match his description.
Regardless, I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia.
Oh....If you didn't have your badge then that would be very *bad*. You would need to report it on my shortwave. But since you *do* have it, we can go straight to the task at hand.

Hello, I'm Kim Kitsuragi..Lieutenant, Precinct 57. You must be from the 41st...
Have you removed the dead body from the tree?
Yes, well...
You may have murdered the man I was supposed to meet and are now impersonating him. You may be his twin, stepping in for his even more incapacitated brother out of loyalty and love.
No, I don't think so..We should ask him for a run-down of the area now that I'm here as well. I understand the scene is out back, right?
It also wouldn't hurt to assure him the police are finally here. In full force, I mean. Have you mapped out the initial interviews?
I can see you drank last night, and the night before,.And that you are still drunk now. But I have seen officers go through worse. Much worse.
Sure. But did you take it down from the tree?
They're not *just* white rectangles. They bear a halogen watermark with the letters RCM and a pattern resembling the street grid of Revachol West. I could step into the headlights of my Kineema and show you, but right now I just need you to do your job.
You seem a little unsure, officer. Have you spent too much time undercover lately?
However, I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia.
I was sent here to meet a detective from Precinct 41. You have the insignia of the Citizens Militia on your sleeve and on your back.
It looks like we had a little scheduling error on Sunday. Saturday too, actually... Have you had time to talk to the manager here?
Good. But even if you haven't, we'll have time for that after we take a look at the coroner's case.
You mean you don't have a badge?
At the 57th, we like to prepare an initial list of persons of interest and then just... skim the surface..Prepare the field, get to know the players. You don't do that? Maybe it's not an inter-district practice...
If you need something for your headache, there is a general store nearby. But, as I said, the dead body should be our number one concern.
After you, officer.
Hello, I'm Kim Kitsuragi..Lieutenant, Precinct 57. You must be from the 41st...
Completely? Does that mean you took the body down from the tree?
Sure. Though I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia.
Losing your identification card is a *serious* matter. My vehicle has a shortwave -- you can use it to report your badge missing. I advise you to try to locate it as quickly as possible. But getting the body down should still take precedence.
Oh....If you didn't have your badge then that would be very *bad*. You would need to report it on my shortwave. But since you *do* have it, we can go straight to the task at hand.

Losing your identification card is a *serious* matter. My vehicle has a shortwave -- you can use it to report your badge missing. I would advise you to locate it as quickly as possible. But getting the body down should still take precedence.
I would ask you to step into the headlights of my motor carriage, but, again, it's none of my concern. I just need you to do your job.
If you don't mind, we should talk to him again. Ask him for a run-down of the area -- now that I'm here as well. I understand the scene is out back, right?
You mean you don't have a badge?
Precinct 41 said they were sending their most seasoned detective. And you certainly look... seasoned.
Right... Now, I know it took us a while to arrive at the scene. It also took you a while to call us and report the dead body -- it *was* you who placed the call, yes?
I am Kim Kitsuragi from Precinct 57. This is an inter-district investigation, so joining me from Precinct 41...
You said you just got here -- from where? Are you a local?
No, don't, there's no need....You really need to take this up with your station, I have a shortwave radio in my car. Call them, ask for assistance. We have to get this investigation started now.
Officer....You really need to take this up with your station, I have a shortwave radio in my car. Call them, ask for assistance. We have to get this investigation started now.
We do not need to assert ourselves here. We only need instructions from him. This is the proprietor, remember?
I didn't imply that..Detective?
Yes, Detective Costeau..I have everything. You?
Mhm..I have everything. You?
I know it took us a while to arrive at the scene. But it also took you a while to call us. It was you who placed the call, correct?
Sir, I understand your concern, but we're here to do a job, and for us to do it, I need you to stay calm.
Sir, leash in your tongue.
The body was behind the building, right -- how do we get there?
Officer,.You need to contact your station. Ask your people for assistance with the money you owe this place. There is a shortwave radio in my car, when you get the time, use it. We need to get this investigation started now.
That's enough.
If you don't have the money, it's okay. None of us are in this for the wages.
I have everything. You?
I'm sorry I couldn't help more..You should take this up with your station, I have a shortwave radio in my car, okay? We have to get this investigation started now.
Mr... Garte, right?.You run this place?
Officer, maybe you're better off working this from home for now? You live in Jamrock, right? It's not that far away.
Khm....Not now.
You mean the strike?
But you still know your way around, yes? In case we need directions.
It is crude of you. A man has been killed. File a request for compensation with Station 41. We need to work now.
Do you have her number?
Thank you,
Officer... I was thinking more along the lines of your name.
It's your turn.
But, you see, he didn't.
No. This is a two-man assignment, because it needs two officers to complete. I need your help.
Officer, you just need to be stronger. Learn to keep it in long enough for us to work. There's nothing else *to* do.
By *ka-ching* do you mean....'Let's not log them as evidence, let's steal them'?
No, you're right. The harbour uses six-rotors to shuffle containers around. They used whatever was on hand here. Without paying attention to not incriminating themselves.
And what kind of lesson is that?
Monday -- make sure you bring a handkerchief.
There's no way you're getting them off. All the organic matter in his body has been flowing down into the boots. They're *fused* to his feet now -- why do you think the locals haven't scavenged them yet?
I don't doubt your physical prowess, officer, but this is a gruelling surgical procedure. I saw twenty steel strands in there -- and we do not have a secure platform for the cutting.
I think you have your sports mixed up there, officer, squaring my shoulders has nothing to do with this.
Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't lose it.
*Extremely* unfortunate. You need to contact your station about it as soon as possible..Try not to lose this one, please.
Yes..The debrief we got from the Wild Pines representative appears to be solid too. A lynching is what this looks like. Our internal RCM brief said the same...
Yes, that's what I said. You'll compromise the coroner's case if you do. So please *don't*.
Even the mongrels can see you're about to pull his head off.
No. You should *not* get a drink. You should perform an initial inspection of the victim's corpse -- we're on the rope part.
Then you should ask me the first moment we get.
I think you're underestimating the gravity of this situation, officer. We need to take a breather from this scene..Now.
At least you understand the gravity of the situation, detective. We need to take a breather from this scene..Now.
No?.You *will* get your shit together.
Stop obsessing about your sexuality officer, you're about to seriously compromise the coroner's case.
Don't provoke her.
I can't say I'm *fully* satisfied with that part. We should search for prints maybe...
Sure you do. You just threw up *a lot*.
No..Your first instinct was correct. This equipment is way beyond what a security guard can afford.
Stop!
That ladder can't carry a grown man. I didn't see any splintering either, did you? I think they lassoed the branch, then pulled on the belt to close the buckle...
I agree. Police work is overrated. It is trying and stressful. However, it is still our job to get the dead body down from the tree.
An honour -- and a burden. Attached to your rank. Mine is *lieutenant-detective* -- unfortunately. I can't tell you how tired I am of this corpse...
If you can handle the headache,.Some officers use it to deal with cadaverine odour.
Honestly, I prefer a *non-acrobatic* solution to this.
We should go and do something else. Give it half an hour. Then come back, when you've gotten your act together.
I've seen *captains* puke their guts out. It never gets easier, you never get used to the smell. Every Monday is cadaver day -- throw up, investigate, throw up, initial autopsy, throw up, bag it...
Okay. Fine. You want to protect the *feet* of six dead men. That's commendable. But...
Oh,.You're trying to assess *lividity*.
Maybe it looks faint to you?.It *could* be more pronounced, actually. Dûment noté.
I've seen strong men turn themselves inside out for hours. You're facing tough odds here. Alcohol withdrawal makes it considerably harder.
For a full set of armour I wouldn't blame you. But these boots are hardly worth a disciplinary hearing. There are better ways to pay a hostel bill. Besides...
That is even *more* unfortunate than the badge. You need to contact your station about it as soon as possible..Try not to lose this one, please.
Are you sure we've finished the preliminary examination of the cadaver? We might miss some of these things once he's down.
Honestly -- a whole set of ceramics: the breastplate, the pauldrons... I wouldn't blame you. But these two? Not worth bringing Internal Affairs into your life over. Besides...
Just something I scraped together from my station. An area report on Martinaise. I'm sure you did the same...
Okay..You should ask me for one the first moment we get.
Who is he? He is male, forty to fifty. With an athletic build.
I told you -- he is male, forty to fifty. With an athletic build..yard.hanged_inland_failed_once_kim_said_hes_fourty
Ace's high!
I am at a loss as well. I could *swear* your shit was together, detective.
The leader of the Union. A dangerous and corrupt man. One you don't want to be *indebted* to.
Then the world will turn away from you, and leave you behind.
You'd have to boil them in acid. Besides...
How about I take *you* piggyback?
I see what you mean, but even so...
It's okay, happens to everyone..Keep it.
Get a hold of yourself.
That's probably a good idea. Clear our heads. But before we can do that...
How many clues do you need? You already found the number. Besides...
So -- what do you think?
Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't lose it.
Someone else?.You mean like... *the police*?
Someone like a paid garbage man? Or a cleaning crew? I have bad news for you -- that *is* a detective.
By the way, when you get the chance -- *perhaps* you should ask me to share the RCM brief you. I'm pretty sure you've *forgotten* it.
You need to get your shit together.
Officer, if I may ask -- what were you trying to achieve by pulling on the deceased foot?
There's no way you're getting them off. All the organic matter in his body has been flowing down into the boots. For *seven* days. They're *fused* to his feet now -- why do you think they're the only thing left on him?
Here -- a souvenir..Don't lose it.
It's not *pity*. You should wipe your mouth after vomiting.
I'm still approaching this as a lynching, yes. Motivated by the ongoing strike..You?
No. You and I are *detectives*. The honorary rank of 'detective' signifies our ability to handle *the entire incident chain*. From crime scene, to autopsy, to clean-up. We do it all.
An appropriate attitude.
Why do you think so?
The leader of the Union. A dangerous and corrupt man, from what I hear -- you don't want to owe him much.
We should keep a lookout for these pieces. The armour could yield information..This is one thing he might actually know...
We should keep a lookout for these pieces. The armour could yield information..This is one thing he might actually know....yard.cuno_intro_hub
Good. Can you read it to me?
I know it's hard. But I assure you -- the others won't come to help us. And we have a *growing* sanitary concern here. We need to get him down, fast.
This had better not turn into another *demonstration* of yours.
Then drive to the station, maybe throw up on the way there if you didn't bag the thing tight enough.
You're going to pull his head off.
You're about to pull his head off.
The brief suggested as much. Politically motivated by the ongoing strike... did you not get a briefing?
I don't doubt your physical prowess, officer, but that's aircraft strength material. And we do not have a secure platform to perform the procedure on.
Don't.
Keep it.
Are you okay, officer?
Okay. You've said it. You needed to say it, and now that you have...
Give it half an hour, get yourself together, then come back and have another go.
Did you hear that? A click?
What are you trying to achieve anyway, why are you hanging on to that boot?
Someone already did. You know who came? We did. Because we have made bad life decisions.
We should keep a lookout for these pieces. The armour could yield information..Maybe he'll know something.
We should keep a lookout for these pieces. The armour could yield information..Maybe he'll know something..yard.cuno_intro_hub
Nor does the wind right now...
You do understand the boots are steeped in cadaverine odour, don't you?
Sure, just don't lose it.
From the gates -- by negotiating or fighting..Or we can try the secret route we found. Where your cloak is. It looked doable.
This is a kinetic re-distributor. It spreads the incoming energy horizontally, from plate to plate. When the plates connect, there's a click. That's the sound you heard..See these lines?
You have a point there, detective. You have a point. But...
Your station would not have assigned you the case otherwise. This case is *important*.
That young woman, the gardener, mentioned she used salts for the smell.
You're facing tough odds here. It's aggravated further by alcohol withdrawal.
*Pull his head off*. There's no point performing an autopsy if you do, we'll have compromised the coroner's case.
How should I know why you're squinting, officer?
It's bad as it is -- us shooting firearms like punks here....Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't hit the victim.
In the name of god, please get a hang of yourself.
The *Armistice* is sufficiently precise, officer. Especially at close range.
By being a damn good shot -- Ace's High!
I *would* suggest we interview Evrart and Joyce -- the leader of the Union and the Wild Pines rep -- but we've already done that. So... it's up to you detective. Take us where we need to be.
With shooting like that -- of course you are. Your station would not have assigned you to this case otherwise.
The hangover is clearly making this worse for you. You could use some ammonia -- to clear your head.
Meaning, this is *a lot* of bullet holes..Looks like fully-automatic rifle fire. Something you don't see these days...
Busted the neck, did you?.Glad I stopped when I did... my neck was really starting to hurt. Don't worry, it'll mend... now, we should get going.
Yes. Looking into your bedroom, miss.
How long have you been staying here?
Unfortunately, no, but if I were to guess -- long enough. The perforation is under the book shelf on your wall. It should not be hard to cover with some tape.
Miss, we are investigating the murder of the man who was hanged..The people responsible have asked us to talk to you.
Miss, we are investigating the murder of the man down there..The people who put him there have asked us to talk to you.
Did you take the documents?
Miss, I don't know what he's told you, but there are no superstars among police officers.
Yes, miss. I hope you don't mind.
I'm Kim Kitsuragi..I'm a detective from Precinct 57. I believe you have already met my colleague from Precinct 41.
I'm Kim Kitsuragi..I'm a detective from Precinct 57. I see you've already met my colleague.
I assure you, he is not about to tear it up in *any* style. In fact...
Thank you, miss..We should do a thorough search of the fishing village.
Thank you, miss..We should do a more thorough search of the fishing village..auto.visited_village
That is not actually what a police siren sounds like.
Yes, I understood that, officer.
I can assure you -- there really, really are *not*.
Thank you for your candour -- why?
Is that something that happens to you often, miss?
It would, wouldn't it? It would be *strange*. You see...
We have questions that might help solve some gaps in our field autopsy. I'm sure my colleague has a few of his own while I take notes.
That's for the police to find out..Right then, please answer each question to the best of your ability. I'm sure we have a few.
You're still not saying it right.
I'm ready when you are.
Yes. That is a downside of having a 130 kilowatt engine..It lets the bad guys know when you're coming.
Let's just get it out of the way as fast as we can. Contact dispatch from my Kineema and ask them to connect you to the station. Maybe they can shed some light on this.
There was a murder in Martinaise..She might be a suspect. We would appreciate your help.
A bullet?
You didn't put it there, did you? *She* did.
Well, if you're not in the hostel in the morning, I'll know where to find you..Here. In a shack.
I see, ma'am..I hope you don't mind if we look around anyway.
Did she talk to you much during her last stay?
I'm ready when you are..Thank you, ma'am.
What did you say.
Let's just get it out of the way as fast as we can. Contact dispatch from my Kineema and ask them to connect you to the station. Maybe they can shed some light on this.
Let's go mail it.
You're not. No one around here considers us an *ill omen*. People would have told us.
Thank you, it's an honour,.We should probably return to our *main* investigation here. This has been refreshing, but...
You *can*?.Fine. It's better than having these people get pneumonia on the coast, but after *this*...
I hope you're not buying this. He dispenses it without letting you touch the canister, so it would be precious, like holy water...
Right. Which means you two can pack up and go back to the Whirling.
Even relative to examining a week-old corpse, I'm not sure mucking about in the reeds qualifies as *fun*... but have it your way, detective...
Khm....Just out of curiosity -- if there's no proof of its existence, how do you know it's real?
Sir, your wife is waiting for you.
Tryin'a score some *dope*, man. Tryin'a score some smack -- you got any?
Yeah, man...
... and neither have you. Had you let me in on the script of this play before you performed it, I could have gone along. As it stands, the entire line of questioning has been compromised.
You..If you were intending to use an unorthodox questioning technique for this branch of the investigation -- which, by the way, is tangential at best -- you should have let me in on it.
We have nothing left to do but hope this *was* a play on your part -- and to move on. Now..We have some questions for you.
'Left it all behind.' Are you sure you did?.Who can tell with all the delinquent behaviour?
As it stands, I'm going to have to thwart your plan by explaining to the woman that we are police officers.
Yes, what *do* you mean?
Tryin'a score some *dope*, man. Like we planned. Tryin'a score some smack -- you got any?
In the future, could you please refrain from emoting too much on duty? The quasi-legal status of the RCM means we need to project strength twice as consistently as any other police force in the world.
Even so, in the future, could you please refrain from emoting too much on duty? The quasi-legal status of the RCM means we need to project strength twice as consistently as any other police force in the world..ice.kim_crying_justify
So, what do *you* think happened?
Thank you.
So you're saying you *didn't* break down in tears just now and nearly tear your shirt off?
Do you, uh, want to *talk* about what just happened?
Glad to hear it was 'minor.' Can you go on?
Yes, I've definitely never seen you cry before, nor lent you my handkerchief to dry your tears.
Good. Controlling your emotions sounds good.
Okay....I *might* have something in my motor carriage we can use. When you're done here.
Thank you anyway.
I assure you, it was him.
Thank you for clearing that up. Why do you keep the container locked?
You can cash it in at the local Frittte, near the harbour gates -- though it might not be enough to cover it...
We should find out who this loud faction is, occupying the booth. Loudness means talkative -- and we need info.
Exactly --.But all in due time. Crypto-business is not a priority right now.
...I feel I must remind you that we are here to conduct an important investigation that also affects *your* business.
No one was implying you were, officer. Where were we?
It was you?
In your defence -- neither do I.
We should return to the case of your *mistaken identity* at a later time, officer. This was about the *trash container*.
Relax, Mr. Garte. I'm sure there is no *Doom*. He simply wants to share his discoveries with you.
Thank you, sir. And he appreciated the clean room, by the way. He just likes to act like he doesn't.
He's right,.you *really* have to sort out your money problems, starting tomorrow. I can't help you again.
We should find out who this loud faction is, occupying the booth. Loudness means talkative -- and we need info.
I thought as much -- and are you the only party with access to the trash container?
Keep them, detective. You earned it.
I understand your predicament as the manager. However...
You might,.It's important not to let one's *style* interfere with their work.
Excuse me. I was lecturing you. I shouldn't have. You should consult a medical professional if you feel that you need help. You can use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's *lazareth*.
If I were trying to get in touch with the Coalition, I would start by seeking him out. But first you might need to speak with his *young companion*.
If you're trying to get in touch with the Coalition, I would start by finding some way to apologise to him. But first you might need to speak with his *young companion*.
Then why did they send you?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't force us into situations where I may have to shoot random civilians. Because that won't get us anywhere.
Excuse me. I was lecturing you. I shouldn't have. You should consult a medical professional if you feel that you need help.
Is that enough of a secret for you?
I think the dispatch desk just told both our stations about the hanging. There was quite the brouhaha at the 57th, I can tell you that. 'Time to *settle it*', they said, '*Cop Off*'. But....I assure you, I am not their *finest* or *toughest*, with *one hundred-and-two cases solved*. What I am is *least interested in a pissing competition*.
... but *am* I? I'll spare you another twenty hours thinking about it -- yes, I am. Now let's get back to work.
If you ask me, it's high time for you to set aside these frivolous *side tasks* and focus 100% of your energies on the case before us.
If you could only find your gun.
Okay. What do you think is going on with that computer, chalkboard, and fireplace?
Hmmm, that's a fair point. Alright, for the good of the investigation, what do you want to know?
For real detective work, nothing beats a good notebook by your side...
Ah, yes. The case brief you missed. Now I remember.
Wonderful..What is your takeaway?
You mean like a brief? Do you want me to brief you again?
You know who might be, though? That Mr. Villedrouin, the uh... gentleman you needlessly antagonised in the apartments...
You know who might be, though? That Mr. Villedrouin, the uh... gentleman you met in the young man's apartment...
It can't be that...
Wouldn't that be something? And who could say it's not true? If you really don't remember anything... how would you know?.We should move.
Sort of like how hanging around the liquor store hasn't made you into a master distiller.
You can always use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's lazareth again. Was there anything else you wanted?
Anyhow, let's get back to the case. Was there anything else you wanted to know?
I have, on a few occasions -- when I was young and foolish -- smoked hemp.
Then you're in luck, because we're in the midst of a *major* strike by the Dockworkers' Union. Maybe more than that. The Union clearly wants a *piece*, not just of the Industrial Harbour, but the Wild Pines corporation itself...
If you ask me, it's past time for you to cut back on the smoking. You seem like a man with a death wish. It's quite disturbing.
It's a good thing you found that gun. I can see why they sent you now.
You did well,
So, what? That makes *you* the *new school*? Gods spare us...
I'm sure you don't. It's just a stupid inter-departmental thing. I'm making assumptions... we should move on.
If you ask me, it's high time for you to put the bottle away. Sober up, get back to basics. That would be my advice.
Do you *need* something, detective?
You wouldn't have been sent to investigate this case if you had close connections with the Union -- at least that's the hope. Also,.you don't strike me as a *Union man*.
Besides, I doubt you could have taken down a hardened mercenary single-handedly...
I'm relieved that you agree,
Fascinating. And here I believed your recent turn toward moralism was just an act.
It's good to have........an *ambidextrous para-detective* in a labour dispute. I can see why they sent you -- should we go?
Are you thinking of... you know?
If you insist. What do you want to know?
I can assure nothing like that will happen. Do you know why not?
Later..Was there anything else you wanted to know about the case?
It's not that many. Officer, I'm sure you have a lot more cases solved. Now...
When you said before that you were *down with racism* -- was it meant in earnest or were you just trying to win his confidence?
I guess you *don't* need glasses, then.
I can *assure* you, detective, that I've passed *all* the required physical exams within the last year. Can you say the same?
What do you want to know?
Strike, coup, revolution, it's brigandage however you parse it.
Have you tried concentrating on something other than your personal affairs?
Then you should consider seeking medical attention. You can use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's *lazareth*. Was there anything else you wanted?
You don't know?.I assumed you were in on it.
I hope you do.
So the 41st Precinct sent you, because you are the most mentally ill out of all the officers at your station?
Either way, good on you..You were saying...?
Yes, cannabis. The hemp. I rolled it into a small paper tube and lit in on fire. Then I *inhaled* the fumes. I was young.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way, it's just a collegial observation. In the 57th we call it the 'Jamrock shuffle'. Officers from Jamrock's 41st Precinct tend to move a bit erratically.
It's just stupidity. We shouldn't waste any more time on it. If you want my take, ask me after we've inspected the victim.
There was some interest in this case at my station, but not for the reasons you have in mind. You seem to wish there was...
Okay -- let's *talk* about it. You stole the boots.
I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to see you're stable..Keep it that way. Now -- was there anything else, or should we get to it?
Of course.
Safe? No. But you're old. You've made it this far. *Something* has brought you through. We've only just started working together, so I don't know what it is yet. But it's there.
Why are you pronouncing it like you're a Coalition bureaucrat?
Why are you pronouncing it like that gentleman from the Institute of Price Stabilité?.apt.sponsor_greeting_done
You know what? Forget it. What *specifically* are you trying to assign responsibility *for*?
No I don't. I *used* to. Plain clothes did the trick. For both of us, it seems..Now...
Do you want me to brief you?
You're barking up the wrong tree. I don't speak a word of Seolite, I've never met either one of my grandparents. And I've never *been* to Seol..I'm a regular Revacholiere.
To be completely honest, detective, I've been meaning to raise that very subject with you.
I bet you do.
Well, we've yet to find any real evidence pointing to you in this case, or even a possible motive, so let's not add you to the list of suspects just yet.
I've been meaning to have a little chat with you about your sense of *style*.
Politics is habit-forming. And hazardous. It is also irrelevant to policework. You are right to doubt the impulse, it might be detrimental to our task here.
It was a joke, sadly. There's nothing I can do about your delinquency..What's done is done. Let's get back to policework.
In Elysium,.Behind our eyes. Like all human beings, detective..The world is what it is. I'm glad to see you're stable. Keep it that way.
You didn't stop at all, did you? You're just obsessing about *other people's* sexuality now.
Yes, uhm....Uhhhh....I don't know what to say..Perhaps...
Which school do you subscribe to -- Mambo.......or Jambo?
This might be just the place to help you rectify your... financial situation.
They say it's a scene-clearing technique developed by one of your lieutenants for gathering evidence. It's erratic, yet thorough. Prioritises containers.
Some *you* time?.This is a police investigation, not a journey of self-discovery. You'll still have your evenings to yourself.
The *cop* kind. Our Precincts can't decide if Martinaise is part of Jamrock or the Industrial Harbour. *Yours* or *mine*, as if we somehow *own* parts of the city. Typical street-gang mentality.... so we've let the Union make a mockery of law enforcement here. And now it's come to its natural conclusion.
Mhm. I don't speak a word of Seolite and I've never met either one of my grandparents. There is nothing *ethnic* I can tell you. Or anyone else.
It's a part of the world, officer. A geopolitical entity -- *and* a geographic division. I told you it wouldn't be interesting.
Was there anything else you wanted to ask about the competition? If not, we should move.
Oh? You will?.Then I will *help* you to do so. Now...
You're right, detective. My apologies.
Ah, right. Your *condition*. Nevermind. All I mean to say is that we have a puzzle on our hands, but not all the pieces... yet.
If you're serious about this, you might keep your eyes out for any Coalition officials we might happen to run across.
What happened to you?
Okay. Well. We are police officers. It is our job to find the killer. So that's what I intend to do. You should try too.
Please do,.We wouldn't want your *regimen* to spill over into the investigation.
Maybe you can tell me what you *do* know? To help me narrow it down a bit.
Really?.You look fine to me.
It is good to have a para-detective in a labour dispute. I can see why they sent you -- should we go?
Was there something else you wished to discuss?
Frankly, detective, you're in a deranged state. I can't let you proceed without *close* supervision. In fact, under normal circumstances I'd be duty-bound to report you. Take it as a token of good faith between our precincts that I haven't done so.
There's no reason to *wing* anything. If you didn't get the brief, that's okay, I did.
Do you know the feeling when you've begun filling in a crossword but some of your answers don't quite seem to fit? That's the feeling I have right now, for some reason...
Congratulations. That must have taken an enormous, concerted effort. *Considerable* ingenuity. And timing. Now -- I'm going to report you and you're going to go to jail.
Am I?.Anyway, did you want something -- related to policework?
Sure..Anyway, did you want something -- related to policework?
... but am I? I'll spare you another *20 hour mind-project* -- yes, I am. Now let's get back to work.
But isn't that *your* job?
Morning.
And what has led you to this conclusion?
Thus far your memory loss does not seem to be *convenient* for you or anyone else. Except insofar as you've managed to avoid doing any work.
So, the death notification...
Is that secret enough for you?
So no, I don't think they sent you as a joke. And even if they did, they are in for a surprise.
Great. Imagine all the time you'll have for work now -- matter of fact, we should get back to it right now.
And I hope we don't even need to discuss the *street drugs* you've been abusing...
Hmm, perhaps you're a more proficient *cruciverbalist* than I am. All I mean to say is that we have a puzzle on our hands, but not all the pieces... yet.
Detective, if I may be frank -- you seem to be in a deranged state. You have trouble remembering things, you've *misplaced* your badge. I cannot let you act in the name of the RCM without supervision until you've regained control of your faculties.
