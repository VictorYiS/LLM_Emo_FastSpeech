God, I was so young... and stupid.
I'm glad to see you here.
I'm glad to see you here..pier.joyce_said_notdrunk
*Oh*. And what happened to yours, detective?
Officer, I don't mean to be rude but are you sure your recent medical episode wasn't a *stroke*?
It's quite simple, you see. Every time the Wild Pines Group makes a decision -- about, what? About *anything* really -- it needs the signature of *each* of the 2,200 workers in its Martinaise terminal.
Yes, past a certain point numbers begin to seem *imaginary*. But they are quite real for the 72,000 employees who depend on Wild Pines for their pay checks...
I was not trying to impress you, I swear. The conglomerate employs 72,000 people, wages cover most of the revenue....TASK.ask_about_ruby_in_village
Of course not. Evrart is *fantastically* corrupt. I imagine he has a thick, viscous goo where you and I have blood.
It's how they circumvent the term limits, you see. With a funny little *switcharoo*. While in office they've embezzled god knows *how* much of their workers' dues.
Organized labour at its best, as they say. Then something happened in the local chapter elections. The Brothers Claire came and transformed it into a... how do you say?
Meth- and dextro-amphetamine, GBL and various synthetic psychedelics. Honestly, it might be quicker to say what you *can't* make from the stuff.
Of course, detectives,.In any case, you've held up your end of our arrangement. I trust you with the rest. Now it's my turn...
Such a tough guy..You have my full cooperation, tough guy -- and that of the Wild Pines Group.
All the best parts of it. Rue de Saint-Ghislaine with its bastions, the plaza's Meteoran mosaic. Even some of the old street lamps have been put back thanks to investments from the WP.
Ha!.I suppose you are, officer. *All*-Revachol. But enough about Evrart -- what else can I tell you about?
I wouldn't normally break protocol like this, but the situation demands it. If you don't solve this murder I'm afraid we may have a blood bath on our hands.
What is... speedfreaks FM?
The sooner the probe is finished the sooner I can share *crucial* information with you..Now, is there anything I can do for you in the meanwhile? Tea, perhaps?
Heavens, no. There have been *two* prior strikes. Both times the Union won significant concessions -- including overtime pay *and* a medical plan. This time their demands are more... I guess you could say *aggressive*.
The information I'm to share with you includes sensitive trade secrets. For the sake of my employer, I have to ask for your name and badge number.
The information I'm to share with you includes sensitive trade secrets. For the sake of my employer, I have to ask for your names and badge numbers.
You may still ask to see my passport,.*That* I'm obliged to share with you.
Some *arlecchinos* you say?.I'm afraid what I need to tell you is anything but *fun* I really need to discuss it, however. With the RCM -- and I need your badge for that.
I have sympathy for your *highly* unusual conundrum, sir. And I believe you. But as it stands I cannot share any confidential information until I've seen a badge.
I have sympathy for your *highly* unusal condition, sir. And I believe you. But as it stands I cannot share any confidential information until I've seen *both* your badges.
Of course..How much do you need.
A first-rate find -- that should tell you all you need to know about their network, I would imagine.
So this goes *beyond* Jamrock... she looks inland. 
And your opinion, detective? If I may ask. I'm a curious and talkative person you see,. Would you say the Débardeurs' Union is...
It may come to nothing, or it may just blow the case wide open. I suspect the traffic jam won't disperse for a few more days. You should have the time you need.
Of course. You have my full cooperation -- and the cooperation of the Wild Pines Group.
It is a relief to see a double-yefreitor here. The situation is precarious to say the least. It needs a quick solution, or we will have a blood bath on our hands.
To answer your question -- yes. They were organized by Wild Pines. The contractors picked them up from Jamrock and drove them over. This is standard practice. The company reserves a right to man its stations.
That's garbage! You're a police officer.
Joyce L. Messier. I represent the board of Wild Pines -- the owners of the harbour. You must be from the RCM...
None taken, officer..Either way, I'm glad you're both here now.
I'm glad to see you here.
But -- I am derailing us. You wanted to know about the strike.
Refreshingly honest, officer..The company has tried appeasing in the past, but I'm afraid our concessions have only emboldened Evrart and his brother.
Of course..But before we do, officer -- let me be perfectly clear...
Of course..But before we do, officers -- let me be perfectly clear...
My.....Why do you say that?
That speaks of the vastness and sophistication of the operation. Were you able to examine the radio?
An ominous vision....At least you understand the gravity of the situation. And the maps should prove very valuable indeed.
You're marbles on glass, dear. Don't worry.
Of course..You have my full cooperation -- and the cooperation of the Wild Pines Group.
'Fuck off, midget.' Gaumont is short of stature, you see.
Have you *seen* him?
It may come to nothing, or it may just blow the case wide open. I can keep the drawbridge up for a few more days at least. You should have the time you need.
I don't believe that for one moment, officer..I'm just going to assume that departmental regulations prevent you from saying anything more...
If these *workers* were organized by Wild Pines or its affiliates, then it would be a company secret. I could not share it with you -- not yet, at least.
As I was saying....If there's *any* way I may be of assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
Perhaps you've noticed that a number of lorries are tangled in a traffic jam at the roundabout just now? Interview the drivers who are still hanging about. One of them might be waiting for a *crucial* shipment.
Of course you're not. It was only a joke.
What I *can* do for you is answer some *questions*. Nothing like talking to pass a rainy day.
I assure you it is no small matter for me either. We *all* share the responsibility for disarming this situation -- I hope you have a badge for me as soon as possible.
I'll be frank with you. If I'm going to break protocol, I need to be able to justify it to my superiors. They're going to want to see something *tangible*.
I'm glad to hear, officer. I'm sure you'll find out just what that means, soon enough.
Evrart Claire is a man of the *utmost* integrity. If you can say one thing about him, it's that he always puts the interests of the workers first.
Joyce L. Messier. I represent the board of Wild Pines -- the owners of the harbour. You gentlemen must be from the RCM...
Uhm....I meant *you* -- the Revachol Citizens Militia. The police.
Hmm. Well, it means nothing to me. I think I'll stick with the factory name. But thank you for the suggestion.
I assure you, they drove quite the hard bargain for this space -- but you're right.
I assure you, they drove quite a hard bargain for this space -- but you're right.
Oh, dear, that *is* serious. If this is in any way dangerous for your health, we can always resume our conversation later.
I don't, in fact..I'm afraid what I need to tell you is wholly unrelated to art. I really need to discuss it, however. With the RCM -- and I need your badge for that.
The... *scabs*?.You mean the huddled masses of Jamrock, come to plead for work where the Union refuses to?
That's a reasonable sum -- not too small, not fantastically large.
That's a good sum. Not too small, not fantastically large like a billion..pier.joyce_asked_billion
That's heartening to hear. There are too few honourable men in Revachol..Now how else can I help the RCM today, besides supplementing its salaries?
By love, you did!
The Union won *significant* concessions -- including overtime pay *and* a medical plan. This time their demands are more... I guess you could say *aggressive*.
Now, per our original agreement, it's time for me to share company secrets with you.
Thank you for the suggestion. I see the word has emotional resonance for you. For me, sadly -- none. So I will stick with the factory name.
Downright *haunting* if you ask me. The Wild Pines suspected foul play, but what could they do? It was a Union matter.
I am sorry for the inconvenience, Lieutenant Kitsuragi. But we need them trapped here. This is a unique opportunity. I'm sure you understand.
I am glad to hear that. Because let me tell you: we are in *dire* waters. The sooner the probe is finished the sooner I can share *crucial* information with you.
Now, is there anything I can do for you in the meanwhile? Tea, perhaps?
Nothing, honestly. I've said it to every drunk in town and you're the first one who's responded.
You stood there for the longest time! And it looked like you were having trouble forming a sentence.
Just so you understand, this is but one of *twenty-two* terminals owned by Wild Pines. Essentially -- not only are they *kings* of the company, they are also kings of the 72,000 employees of Wild Pines Group.
Why do you think so?
In any case, you've held up your end of our arrangement. Now it's my turn...
I fear I've told you all I know..It's an Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- or some version of it. It depicts the travels this man made while he was still alive.
Uhm....I really did bring as little cash as possible, to avoid attention. So here you are, the last of bit of filthy *lucre* I can share.
I can't hear you, darling... speak up, please.
Hmm, I suppose that one *does* have a rather loud electrical engine..A specific drone. In any case....
Then certainly you must know that under the Wayfarer Act the RCM doesn't have the authority to demand anyone's operator license. Freedom of movement and all that.
You know more than you let on..Certainly it helped, but most of the original indotribes have failed or been absorbed. To survive Wild Pines had to grow and adapt. No suzerain did that.
I was hoping your *condition* was rhetorical, detective. A questioning technique.
If these *strikebreakers* were organized by Wild Pines or its affiliates, then it would be a company secret. I could not share it with you -- not yet, at least.
Excuse me, I didn't hear you.
That's a good sum -- not too small, not fantastically large.
That's a good sum. Not too small, not fantastically large like a billion..pier.joyce_asked_billion
Well,.here's your chance.
Very absurd,.Thank you for the suggestion. I will stick with the factory name for now -- but thank you.
Very rugged,.Good choice. Now, I suspect you had questions -- nothing like talking to pass a rainy day, am I right?
I cannot rescind that promise..To my knowledge, the drivers are still at the roundabout. I will tell you *everything* I know -- when you've finished with them.
Of course there are..We are on an archipelago. How else are you supposed to get around?
You have my full cooperation.
Then you might also like their other slogan: 'DEMAND DEMOCRACY!'
Pleased to meet you, lieutenant,
I will be frank with you..If I'm going to break protocol I need to be able to justify it to my superiors. They're going to want to see something very *tangible*.
Excuse me, I didn't hear you..Did you say *money*?
That's a good sum -- not too small, not fantastically large.

I... see....So are you saying you *lost* your badge during the course of this *episode*?
*Or*....You can recover your badge -- though if I may be blunt with you, it sounds like that may be a lost cause.
I am very sad to hear that, officer..If you change your mind, please let me know. If not, good luck finding your badge -- and your memory.
I appreciate you placing your trust in me. Thank you again for looking into this matter. You have my gratitude -- and the gratitude of Wild Pines Group...
I assure you, officer, these are *not* the sort of parties you'd want to attend.
Very keen of you, officer. I do also have *saudetic syndrome* from overexposure to the pale. It makes me roost in the night. Like an owl.
I'm glad you asked. There was a woman -- the previous forewoman of the Union. She disappeared.
That's a good sum -- not too small, not fantastically large.

Oh, so you've *met* him..Has he beguiled you with his inane theories?
You mean someone *stole* your badge?
No matter *whose* it is. A motor carriage is just a tool. You need it to do your job -- as I do mine. It's just a means of getting where you need to go.
Technically speaking, you *don't*.
I can see your hand is getting tired now -- there is no need to continue. No one is keeping score.
A pleasure to meet you, Harry -- what happened to your badge?
The *performative experience* has ended. Good -- what can I help you with?
I... fail to see the relevance of this station, but....I'll defer to your judgement. Was there anything else?
Now's neither the time nor the place to discuss such matters. What else did your investigation turn up?
Right..It's really not the time or place to discuss such matters. What else did you find in your investigation?
How interesting..I wish you a swift recovery. In the meanwhile, you have my *full* cooperation. And the full cooperation of the Wild Pines Group.
My plan is to share information. The only way to do that *now* is by telling my employers you've kept your end. Which I hope you will, because let me tell you: we are in *dire* waters.
My mother had a stroke. She exhibited similar problems -- although not *quite* like yours.
Why, thank you.
Yes -- and? Will you start an official investigation?
And even *if* I did I still would not give you ten thousand reál. I would rather buy something nice with it. Like expensive hi-fi or a new *Hydrodynamique E40* sail.
It's a medical thing. It's called... *old*. I'm old you see.
I think I'll stick with the factory name. But thank you.
I'm glad to see you here.
You mean *eel's hips* -- but point taken. I am a bourgeois woman and this is my fast, light, interminably bourgeois boat.
Good luck -- It's only kept in place by the vested interests of half the civilized world, including your own.
I *do* believe you -- naive as that may sound. I simply can't imagine what you'd gain by *faking* such a condition.
Yes. But you won't get anything out of Evrart and the Dockworkers' Union. Still --.every chain has its weak link.
Okay. I thank you for sharing that much with me..My employer thanks you as well...
That's a good sum -- not too small, not fantastically large.
That's a good sum. Not too small, not fantastically large like a billion..pier.joyce_asked_billion
Which he most certainly will do..Now, how else can I help the RCM today, besides supplementing its salaries?
I can't see why it *wouldn't* be okay. Now, what can I do for you?
Officer, I assure you I'm a highly qualified pleasure craft operator.
Drinking less sounds like a great start!.Go on -- you have my full cooperation.
I am glad you see it that way. To repeal the act would mean *repealing* the Coalition government. The one that leases you the right to police West Revachol...
How do you think they're financing this strike? There are thousands of unpaid dockworkers going strong for the fourth month straight.
It is. Fast and silent..Try again, but lower.
That's a good sum -- not too small, not fantastically large.

Pleased to meet you, Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Du Bois. I am glad to see a man of high qualification -- the situation is precarious.
We contain multitudes, do we not? It might not be pertinent to her... *profession*, but who knows? It may help you find her yet.
I'm not really *big* on moralist symbols. I think I'll stick with the factory name. But thank you.
You're back. Good..What can I help you with -- at this late hour?
You're back. Good..What can I help you with -- not an umbrella, I hope. I don't need one myself, you see...
Surely you're aware that under the Wayfarer Act the RCM doesn't have the authority to demand anyone's operator license. Freedom of movement and all that.
First you'd have to repeal the Emergencies Act of Trade and Aliments that gives me the right to silence. It's quite the octopus.
Oh heavens no! We get along just fine... Yet now that you mention it, I can't stop imagining that black treacle... Just dribbling down his double chin...
Well....I suppose that's *one* way to look at it -- they're an interesting composition, albeit vile. But enough about Evrart -- what else can I do for you?
In the meantime, I'll still try to assist you any way I can. This disagreement is peanuts compared to what happens if you fail your main investigation.
On the contrary, officer,.There are yet camionneurs you have not talked to. And don't look so surprised. In a time like this it would be strange if Wild Pines *didn't* have eyes on the harbour.
Ha!.If the workers were organized by Wild Pines then it would be a company secret. I could not share it with you -- not yet, at least...
Why yes, I am rich. How much money do you need? Hopefully not too much, I couldn't bring all of it with me.
What can I help you with, lieutenant-yefreitor?
Ah, good to hear. I wouldn't want to pry into a confidential police matter. But, in the event you'd like to share more... I *would* like to know who it was.
The company has tried looking into this matter before -- to no avail. Perhaps someone with *your* authority and resources might turn over the right stones?
Why, by throwing off half a century of foreign domination under the Coalition! Unfortunately for you, the Coalition also leases you the right to police West Revachol...
I'm not at liberty to discuss the company balance sheet, but I *can* tell you that last year the company booked more than 20 billion reál in revenue.
Or a mob..Sadly, Wild Pines have cooperated with what amounts to a crime syndicate for two decades. However much you feed the wolf -- the wolf always hungers.
Indeed. And a hungry one..Sadly, Wild Pines have cooperated with what amounts to a crime syndicate for two decades. However much you feed the leech -- the leech always hungers.
Ha!.A real Man of the Left. What else can I tell you about?
Until you come up with something at that intersection I'm afraid I have little else to tell you -- but I'll try. Ask.
If they were organized by Wild Pines or its affiliates then it would be a company secret. I could not share it with you -- not right now at least...
Better not to tie the forestay to the backstay on this. I hope there is something else I can help you with?
No, you don't. One reál won't get you two pieces of bath tissue to rub together.
So,.I hope I didn't just *bribe* you, officer. It may not be technically *illegal* under the Emergency Act, but still...
I suggest you go back and canvas for more suspects.
Thank you -- I do what I can to remain presentable. Now, ask me some questions. It'll help us pass the night.
Okay..If you want to get technical. The point is we're *all* on islands here. And sail is still the most expedient way to get from one island to another. Especially when you're in a hurry to resolve a *strike*.
Of course..Please accept my apologies. What can I help you with?
If you have doubts about your brain's blood supply, well... that's what we call a serious matter.
Thank you for being candid,.Sadly, Wild Pines have cooperated with what amounts to a crime syndicate for two decades. However much you feed the wolf -- the wolf always hungers.
Well,.here's your chance, officers.
In any case, it's a relief to know someone has looked into it. If I may ask -- will there be an official investigation? I assume you discovered there *is* an operation...
Ah yes, of course, I'm sad to hear that..How much do you need?
Nevertheless, he sounds *terribly* dangerous. I urge you to take care, officer. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
I have a medical condition of my own -- nothing unusual, though. I'm *old* you see.
*Or* you can find your badge, which, honestly, seems like a lost cause.
You may still ask for my passport.
A stroke could partially explain the *memory trouble* you've been experiencing.
I imagine a man like you can take quite the *lashing*..But I believe we were talking about the *strike*.
You mean someone *stole* your badge?
Yes, my eyes on the harbour have sent word to that effect -- what have you discovered?
I like high fidelity *anything*, sir..Now try again, but lower.
So,.I hope I didn't just *bribe* you, officer. It may not be technically *illegal* under the Emergency Act, but still...
Au contraire, officer. I also feel queasy about the pittance the Coalition calls your salary. Now is there something else I can do for you, or did you want to chat about *dialectics* some more?
What would you like to know?
You know....I don't mean to sound cold, but if you want something, you have to give something back. *More* than just guilt.
How curious..Why is that, detective?
More curious by the minute....Why is that, detective?.pier.joyce_curious_once
Oh my, the *E-word*..You mean to say that it's a symbol of *conspicuous consumption*? That I'm a member of the ruling class.
I'll be explicit: if you find this driver, I will share company secrets with you.
Precisely. Smuggled out of that very gate at night, most likely. Then loaded onto lorries and driven to Jamrock. You simply need to find *one* driver who'll open up to you.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you,.The wind is a bit strong, could you repeat that?
It's all right, lieutenant..I really did bring as little cash with me as possible, to avoid attention. So here you are -- the last bit of filthy *lucre* I can share.

Perhaps the arrangement no longer stands... excuse me, it's not my place to pry. If it does you should take advantage of it. Just a suggestion.

Well, I can't stop you, can I? Just understand that I don't *expect* you to share anything he told you with me. I'm not a *corrupt würm* myself..However, if you felt like passing *some* information...
Well, maybe he's not as *helpful* as you thought then? Is there anything else?
My-my! What I'm hearing is....You inspected a premises because you suspected that it was involved in the narcotics trade...
*And* in the process you turned up some information relevant to your investigation. Only from Evrart, surprisingly!
Of course. And I don't expect you to share anything he told you with me. I'm not a *corrupt würm* myself..However, if you felt like passing *some* information...
Ah yes. As you said.
The strike brew,.That's a classic. And by *turn up the heat* I presume you mean *put more alcohol in it*?
Or he wants you and me to *believe* he wants to go to war.
Full of ghosts and ancient memories..Has this errand yielded you any... information?
I will try to do so, detective. If not for you, then for Revachol.
I will try to do so, Harry..If not for you, then for Revachol..pier.joyce_harrier
Unfortunate..I won't pry further into the details of your investigation, but let me just say -- I have *full* trust in your competence.
Which isn't to suggest our talks constitute *corporate espionage*. Even *if* they did -- it would be fine. But they don't, since you logged the money as a donation and this is *clearly* just gossip between friends.
Of course. Thank you for the advice -- I'm glad you were here to assist..Your *other* dealings with Evrart are still of considerable interest to me...
Of course. The RCM has the right to inspect any premises..How else would you catch the bad guys? The information was useful I hope?
Watch out for yourselves. They will strike soon.

You misunderstand, detective. We're all answerable to someone.
The company did not 'send mercenaries after the Union'. I told you, in great detail, about the mistakes my side made. And of course I accept them completely.
So very, very helpful,.And how is that going? Do you have any *leads* on that gun?
In short, detective, we will revoke the pigment standard. Your money will no longer need to be black like chitin -- and there will be *so* much more of it.

Lieutenant Du Bois? HARRY!
Never mind the details, we've wasted enough time as it is. What matters is that you *seem* to have got out of it...
Stupendous!.I didn't think he'd pull through.
I have a *bad* feeling about this -- please just say you have it. No loops, darling..pier.joyce_evrart_gun_loop_done
Don't worry about that one article, dear -- regional papers are useless anyway. You probably spared the man his kneecaps. And *I* can be sure that the local shops have a bone to pick with Evrart.
Hurry up on that probe. The moment you tell me you're finished at the traffic jam, I will *gladly* tell you the company's side of the story.
What do you suggest I do?
I have not deceived you. I told you who exactly who I was -- Rejoyce Leyton.
I have not deceived you. I showed you who I was -- Rejoyce Leyton..pier.joyce_vesper_and_rejoyce_seen
No, detective -- no one's as insane as you.

As your investigation reaches a climax, so does theirs. They are your shadow. Arm yourselves. Armour yourselves...
Weird? Oh no. One of the positive things to come from the Revolution is the *unhindered* exchange of information, you see, even when it comes to *trade secrets*...
You have?.And how did you like Mr. Claire?
*Beyond* curious. I will *choose* to interpret that as you turning the alcohol in the strike brew *down* -- for the sake of our professional relationship.
I hope she wasn't a serious suspect then -- as to the suicide -- that must be *difficult*. Yet, in your line of work...
I'll think it over, detective. Thank you for relaying this information to me.
Well, I hope it yields something. Otherwise you'll have opened that door for naught..Anything else?
I will take your advice, detective. I will surrender Terminal B to the Union.
I will take your advice, lieutenant-yefreitor. I will surrender Terminal B to the Union..pier.joyce_harrier
The age of capital has only begun. I will talk to my employers in person. We will amputate and cauterize Martinaise -- if you handle the situation on the ground.
Thank god -- and indeed *Mr. Evrart* as well. In this investigation one may have *use* for a firearm -- you wouldn't want to get caught with your pants down...
And you too, lieutenant,.The situation is perilous, but I am *sure* you're dedicated to avoiding further loss of life. Unlike the Union, who won't even let me talk to them.
Soon. I do not know precisely. They have cut off all communication, you see. They know I've been feeding you information.
