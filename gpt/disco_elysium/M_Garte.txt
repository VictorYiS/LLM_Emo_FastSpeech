Yes, you are! A real decorated hero.
Yes, yes, he means do you have questions for me. Like a police officer would.
The ledger does! The ledger has a memory!.The drinks are non-negotiable, there's no way your station will pay for them.
Don't thank me. You still owe me 30 for the drinks! If you don't have it by tonight I'm not letting you back up there...
Are you trying to frighten me now?.What is this?
Oh, thank you.
What is this, a joke to you? Is *this* what you get when you call the police now? *This* guy?.We've been waiting for a week here!
What are you, a philosopher?
See that door there?.Go out and turn right. There's a....There's a big hole in the fence. No need for a key, just go through that hole and you'll be in the courtyard.
What are you -- crazy? Of course I didn't *kill* him.
Oh..I meant the Union dockworkers. You know, the guys who *everyone* is saying killed him. Which no one is saying about me -- because I didn't.
Why would I have a problem with you? You're a hero cop.
Oh my god! What is your *obsession* with this Sylvie person? Get over it!
The drinks are on the house, okay? There were *a lot* of drinks on the tab. I still have to charge you for three nights and the broken window, though -- that's 100 square.
Am I? Or did you ride in, take the body down, solve the murder, and *not* trash my hostel room?
Wow, you're a genius! Yes, that's right -- money. You owe this establishment 130 reál.
You mean somewhere else to run up a huge debt? I don't think so. The Union squeezed most places out of business to fund the strike. You're better off home.
You can look, but... the Union squeezed most people out of business to fund the strike. So, I don't know... your best shot is just going home.
No -- you see -- actually you didn't. You haven't done anything even remotely useful since you got here.
Don't thank me. You still owe me 70. If you don't have it by tonight I'm not letting you back up there,
I don't know. Am I?
What is this, a joke to you? Is *this* what you get when you call the police now? *This* guy?.We've been waiting for a week here!
Fine, fuck this. I'll do it myself, I'll call your station... what was it, 41? I'll ask them to pay for the room. The drinks and the window you still have to pay for. That's 70. Are we done, officers?
What did you *not* do? First you took the body down, then you solved the murder, then you *didn't* trash my hostel room. Maybe you even negotiated the strike?
Thank you ever so much.
Ma'am, are you alright?
For survival, to pay *me*. Unless you want to become a *hobo*? Do you want to become a hobo? There's nowhere else to stay in Martinaise and it's a cold spring outside. Money doesn't make you happy but it lets you be *un*happy for a while longer.
Good for you. Was there something else? I'd like to get back to what I was doing.
Not *entirely* cool. You still owe me 100 reál. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you back up there...
No -- you see -- actually you didn't. You haven't done anything even remotely useful since you got here.
What is this, a joke to you? There's a dead body out back, and it's been there for a week now! No one wants to work in these conditions!
I don't really know. You'll have to ask her.
She just, you know...
You can't arrest me, I haven't done anything.
Fine, I'll take it off the bill! You want to sleep in a post-apocalyptic shit-hole, go ahead! But I'm not giving you another room.
Fuck you, man.
Haven't you asked me that already? What is it with you and this woman? She has nothing to do with this. 
What are you, a chauvinist then? Hah!

whirling.garte_altgreeting_done
Let's see..Three nights at a tariff of 20 reál comes to 60 reál. Then there's the window you *annihilated* -- the hole in the window was the first thing I saw when I came to work, so don't try to tell me you didn't! That will be 40 reál in damages.
But it's not inane, I just... you owe me money.
Oh!.You don't owe me *shit*? Well, officer, you're right -- you *don't* owe me shit, you owe me MONEY.
Look, your *buddy* is over there.
Why don't you go and talk to him, okay?
Oh, excuse me. You owe me 130 *reál*.
I asked an employee out. She didn't want to come, but felt obliged to. It was a bad idea. Now what is so god damn fascinating about that for you? It's got nothing to do with the lynching.
Okay, you'll only have to pay for the window. And the drinks. That's 70. I'll get the rest from your stupid station.
I don't know who killed him, I'm not the police. That's your job.
Is it? Because I thought you were supposed to be investigating the lynching, not my employer conduct.
You're right. It's not.
No, you don't owe me street cred. You owe me money. You owe this establishment 130 reál.
Another thing you've annihilated is half the bar -- you've run a tab of 30 reál. Actually more, but we'll round it down to 30 for your hard work maintaining the stability and order of Revachol. That's 60 + 40 + 30 = 130 reál. And yes, reál is still money.
I'll call them for recompensation for the room. But you still owe me 70 for the drinks and the window. And I do *not* think women are mentally inferior to men.
Not *entirely* cool. You still owe me 60 reál for three nights stay. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you back up there...
She went away because *none of your business*.
Does she? Maybe she does... maybe she *pertains* to the apocalypse..Sylvie is not here because I asked for her number. The dead body out back didn't help either, but it was mostly me. I hope you appreciate that...
What did you *not* do? First you took the body down, then you solved the murder, then you *didn't* trash my hostel room. Maybe you even negotiated the strike...
Yes, I know where *some* things are. But, as I said, I don't live here. I just used to work here. And I'm not going to start working here again, if that's what you think.
No, not *cool*. You still owe me 30 for the drinks. If you don't have it by tonight I'm not letting you back up there...
Okay, fine. I'll take it off your bill! Sleep in a post-apocalyptic hell-hole if you want to. Just know I won't give you another room.
What are you, an idiot?! I told you I haven't killed anyone!
Never mind? *Gloaming*? What is this? Is *this* what you get when you call the police now?.*This* guy? Lieutenant, we've been waiting for a week here!
Not so fast..You owe me 130 reál.
I don't really need you to *say* anything, I just need the money.
Are you serious? From your work, I don't know... you can take bribes, I guess..I'm sorry. I don't think cops take bribes.
Am I? Or did you ride in, take the body down, solve the murder, and *not* trash my hostel room?
You're right, you didn't. And it's only taken you *three days* not to.
It is, isn't it?
No,.you cannot.
That's a real pity.
Are you sure, ma'am?
So *now* you're a cop? Forget it.
You owe me *money*, not a skin care product. Money. You owe this establishment 130 reál.
You're right, you didn't. And it's only taken you *three days* not to.
Is this what you get when you call the police now? We've been waiting for a week here!
Oh no,.You're a hero. A real hero cop.
Are you serious right now?
You know, I get this all the time. Some hobo comes in here, or some backpacking asshole off the boat. The next day when they can't make their fees they get *aggressive*. I just never thought I'd be in this shit with a cop. Please, just give me the money...
Don't thank me yet. You still owe me 60 reál for three nights stay. If you don't have it by tonight, I just can't let you up there...
Okay, you got me. She went away because of the dead body out back -- and because I asked for her number. That's why Sylvie went away. I hope you appreciate that...
It's you, it's obviously you. *You* smell like liquor. And you're orange.
No, I only just got here. It was probably Sylvie who called you. She usually works the bar here. I'm only temporarily taking over her duties.
Not so fast Mr. Feminist..You owe me 130 reál.
And for god's sake watch out for yourself.
You're right. It's not.
No, I haven't *seen you around*. I'm not always here.
If you run out of money, you die. It's like that for all of us -- me too. That's why I need you to pay me..I'm not an asshole.
No, I haven't *seen you around*. I just got here, remember?.Was there anything else?
Oh..People are saying it was the Union dockworkers. That it was a lynching.
Oh, so apparently I'm a *bitch* now. Okay, I'll be the 'bitch', and you'll be the broke cop who owes me money, and no one will arrest anyone because that's insane. How's that?
No, you see....That's 40 *cents*. Cents are a form of currency one hundred times smaller than the reál. I'm not even going to take this. Come back when you have 130 reál.
Okay, okay....I know what is going on -- and okay. I'll call your station... what did you say it was?
Don't thank me yet. You still owe me 100 reál. If you don't have it by tonight, I just can't let you up there...
Yes, you are!.A real decorated hero.
What are you, brain-damaged?
You still owe me 70. If you don't have it by tonight I'm not letting you back up there,
That's easy! See that door there?.First you exit through that. Then to your right you should see a big hole in the fence -- a really big one. You can get to the courtyard through there. No need for the keys. The hole is big enough for the Franconigerian cavalry to fit through.
Are you kidding me?
Especially when you're so busy doing *nothing* to stop psychopaths. How could you just stand there? Still, you did risk your life...
Yes, the bird. I found it lying on the floor with a broken wing the morning she left.
The bird you brought me a replacement for..The skua I had, remember? I found it lying on the floor with a broken wing the morning she left..TASK.take_bird_to_garte_done
Not at all, officer..It's true. You don't *have to* pay me anything.
No. You can choose to give me 20 reál for a room or you can choose not to. I don't care what you decide.
You already have the key to your new room. I gave it to you earlier -- to unlock the trash container, remember?
You do that. If you can pay another 20 reál, I'll give you the room again. If not, the key and the garbage will be waiting. Free of charge.
Now, is there anything you wanted?
I don't care what you do. Sleep in the trash or pay for a room -- I don't care anymore.
You're expecting a package? To arrive for you here?
Thanks, I guess....Was there anything else you wanted, or...
Is there something I can do for you?
What?.What does that mean -- *cock carousel*?
I'm not a fishing-teacher..That is not why we keep our trash locked. Any place with a kitchen does it, it's not *political*, I assure you.
Oh, sorry, I think you misunderstand. Let me explain..I didn't say *I'd give you a free room*. I just said you don't have to pay me.
She broke the bird, you know. The great skua. I found it on the ground with a broken wing. On the morning she left.
She broke the bird, you know. The great skua, not the grouse you brought. I found it on the ground with a broken wing. On the morning she left..TASK.take_bird_to_garte_done
Wonderful. *Try* to do that. I'll have to call you an ambulance.
Evidence being money. You can't stay here without *money*.
Great, thank you officer, that's *all* I wanted -- payment for services rendered. If you continue to stay here, I just ask that you please pay your nightly bill in advance, starting tomorrow.
Absolutely not. That would be idiotic. I have no idea why you're even saying this right now...
I mean, you're a detective, perhaps you can track them down? Shouldn't be that hard...
Where was *I*? How do you think I know the crazy shit you pulled off out there? I was *there* -- out on the balcony, protecting my establishment.
Anyway -- thank you for clearing it up. Now, if there isn't anything else...
There is no gaping maw. If you don't want to tell me you don't have to. It's okay.
Perfectly serious..You don't *have to* pay me anything.
But you know what? You're in luck. Because you don't have to ever pay me again.
Does that arrangement include... you paying me *what we already agreed* you owe me?
The electronic lock to your room will remain disabled till 21.00 tomorrow.
Thanks. I hope you found what you were looking for.
I hope at least your partner is recovering quickly. Also!.You're staying here for *free* now. That's right. This establishment supports cops. Even cops like you.
Sure. Anyway, I can't help you there. A lot of women come and go here.
Does it mean you talked to her? What else did she say about me?
No. It was her..She's off to ride that carousel you told me about. Heh....Cock carousel -- I understand now.
Oh, that's so sad to hear,.I'd *totally* let you sing karaoke, if you only had a tape -- *and* you'd paid your bills.
Now -- was there anything else you needed?
You do that. If you can pay another 20 reál, I'll give you the room again. If not, the garbage is yours. Free of charge.
The electronic lock to your room has been disabled till 21.00 tomorrow.
Great, perfect, I hope you enjoy your freezing cold room with the window you broke *yourself*.
By the way, if you hadn't paid before 21.00, your door would have been locked electronically.
I'll have it fixed at once. Thank you for letting me know. I assure you -- the Whirling does *not* abide spying on its guests.
Thank you, I'll patch it up personally. Was there something else about the establishment? I hope not...
I vouch for my staff as I would for myself... and I certainly wasn't the one making holes in our walls.
Well?
I don't really use words like that to describe my clients, and maybe you shouldn't either….Seeing as you're a cop and all.
Can I help you?
I hope at least your partner is recovering quickly. Also!.You're staying here for free now. That's right, this establishment supports cops. The stay is free -- the drinks are not,.Just felt I needed to specify that.
Like what? I was really enjoying talking about the *money* you owe me...
Even more reason for me not to serve you, sir. Was there anything else you needed -- other than alcohol?
You want a free place to sleep? Fine.
Right. Is there anything you wanted?
Anything else I can do for you, officers?
What about them?.One is a basement dive frequented by chain-smoking communists. I can't *tell* you how sick I am of Kras Mazov and Ignus Nilsen and all those old ghosts...
Well?
Because you haven't taken it away yet, and it must be stinking *hard* about now. Well -- you're not putting it here. Rest assured.
I give credit where credit is due and that, sir -- was a nice shot. I was watching until you hit him, crawled inside then. Bullets started flying. Anyway...
God... does it mean you talked to her? What else did she say about me?
They ride the cock carousel until the clock runs out. Here. Have the rest.
We were just paying you a compliment. And finding out a *degenerate* from room 3 nicked the phone line. Everything is okay here!
No. I know you just broke it open. You don't need the key and I'm not giving it to you.
Why on Earth did you have to break the skua?!
It's not for bands, it's for clients. *Some* clients, okay? Not you.
Fine. Fine. *After* you've paid your bills you can climb that stage and do whatever the hell you need to do. *After*..Damn this karaoke machine...
Don't thank me yet. You still owe me 60 reál for three nights stay. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you up there...
Forgive me for saying this, but your colleague seems more committed to drinking and...
And want me to make an exception for you? You're not even a hostel guest till you pay your outstanding bills...
Well?
Oh, you're up..It's good to see you back on your feet. Did you like your room? I cleaned it for you.
Oh, you know....People don't tend to stick around after shoot-outs. Turns out they're not good for business.
Yes, yes. For the dead body. You want to put a dead *corpse* into my fridge, right?
Fucker?.Lay off the swear words, they don't make you *cool*. This isn't kindergarten.
No, I was... just wondering..If you found pinball machines there...
Was there something you *wanted*?
Anything else you need?
I understand. Is there anything else you want?
Maybe you could send the shoes to him? In the hospital. Maybe it'd cheer him up. Do you know where he is?
Alright..Did she say anything else? About me, you know..Did she say anything about *me*?
Not *entirely* cool. You still owe me 60 reál for three nights stay. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you back up there...
Not until you bring me the money.
You're welcome. I thought it would be nice for you to wake up in a clean place after you -- let's be fair -- defended this establishment and its clientèle from gunfire.
Well -- I *have* a fridge and you're not putting it here.
Yeah, neither do I. Thank you for telling me I guess. Good thing she pays for her stuff on time -- I'll forward her the bill and be done with it.
Now, is there anything you wanted?
I see..Well, thank you for the intel anyway. Shame about the bird.
As a police officer, you must understand that I cannot take you at your word -- without *evidence*.
If you had a warrant, you'd be shoving it in my face right now.
Anything else I can do for you?
If you say so.
I think *fugue states* are more your *forte*, officer.
For survival, to pay *me*. Unless you want to become a *hobo*? Do you want to become a hobo? There's nowhere else to stay in Martinaise and it's a cold spring outside. Money doesn't make you happy but it lets you be *un*happy for a bit longer.
So yeah..I guess I'm what you call a bad ass.
Now what the hell did you want? I assume you *wanted* something to come back here...
Because I'm not a bartender. I'm a cafeteria manager. Is there anything else you wanted?
Fine. Was there something you wanted?
Oh my god, the package -- I forgot, yes, yes it did arrive, when you were...
Oh, that's so sad to hear,.I'd *totally* let you sing karaoke, if you only had a tape.
Don't thank me yet. You still owe me 100 reál. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you up there...
They're probably getting drunk. Or *protesting* something somewhere. Or laying low after the, you know, lynching.
The electronic lock to your room has been disabled till 21.00 tomorrow.
Starting tomorrow, *please* pay for each night in advance. Twenty reál per night. If you don't have the money it's over for you, got it? You've got nowhere else to stay.
Sure. That's it then. You're not getting into the room. Sort your shit out elsewhere.
Good. It's good you're sorry. I'm not letting *anyone* up there anymore. Now what did you want?
So if you didn't have anything else to tell me -- about my establishment -- can we, you know, wrap it up?
Don't be an imbecile, I'm not going to serve you a Marinella. I have work to do -- and broken things to fix -- if that was all, I'd like to return to it.
I don't make the rules. Pay 20 reál or sleep in the trash container. I don't care which you do. The key is yours if you want it.
Right... I'll tell you what. I'll find out if you like, and can send them on to him. What do you think?
No. But we could... *diversify* the entertainment options. Seeing as you've opened the door back there... The machine we have in the corner now is broken.
Great, thank you officer, that's *all* I wanted, payment for services rendered.
Anything *else* I can do for you, officer?
The electronic lock to your room will remain disabled till 21.00 tomorrow.
What's that supposed to mean? Fuck you, buddy -- she's not my taste. Good thing she pays for her stuff on time, I'll forward her the bill and be done with it.
Oh? Okay. Well..I did hear you make noise back there. So -- good for you.
Just bring them back once you're done, please.
Well, you're not getting it!.*Asshole*!
Right....I'll tell you what. I'll find out if you like, and can send them on to him. What do you think?
Well?
Well?
Really *cool* man -- yeah..Entitlement. Everybody likes that -- everybody likes an entitled person who doesn't know how to say thank you.
'Defended' may be putting it a bit generously, though. I had a great view of you doing *nothing* to stop those psychopaths. Then I crawled inside. Bullets started flying. Anyway...
Because this is a *culinary* establishment, not a morgue. I can't believe you even asked me.
You know, I was *about* to congratulate you on your great aim -- but seeing as you're so special already, I'm going to tell you the truth instead. You missed. And you suck. It was an awful shot.
Good. You got the room for the night, but remember -- you'll need *another* 20 reál tomorrow.
*Callous*? What are you, Kras Mazov? Almost all establishments in Revachol keep their trash locked. The Whirling-in-Rags is not special in that regard.
Right. Well, there you are. Now, was there anything else you wanted?
Anything else I can do for you, then?
No. I don't feel bad enough to give you a refund. Now, is there anything else you want?
No, your package isn't here yet,.I told you I'd let you know.
What are you, a cook now? That's none of your business.
Do I *look* like I'm laughing? Do you see a *smile* on my face? I know what this is about. This is about the electronic lock not letting you in your room -- and it's anything but *funny* to me.
I'll unlock the electronic lock to your room..All the doors lock automatically at 21.00.
You're already set for the night. Your door is unlocked.
This is a *culinary* establishment, not a morgue -- you don't have to ask me *why* you can't store a dead body in my kitchen.
Lieutenant -- you too?.*You're* asking too?! No. The answer is no. I will not turn this place into some kind of *macabre* circus.
Also!.You and your partner are staying here *free* now. I'm not gonna let you ruin it for him. This establishment supports cops. Even cops like you.
I'm glad she got out of here before all that. Bullets flying and stuff... people inside were quite terrified you know. I had to take action and step outside too...
No, of course it's not *cool*..What am I supposed to do with your *net worth*? I need cash, moron.
This again?.You just won't let it go, will you? Real funny.
But this establishment only takes cash. Now, do you have that cash, Mr. Novelty Cheque Man?
Now. I still have to charge you for three nights and the broken window -- that's 100 square.
Speedfreaks FM? I -- no, you don't have any packages waiting for you here. Anything else?
Besides, the RCM doesn't *do* search warrants. I know the law. You'll just have to wait for the kitchen to open -- if you *have* to get in there. Which you don't.
Game? *Everything* is just a game to you, isn't it?
Yes, your police skills have delivered. I'm sure you'll get a commendation. Maybe even a promotion.
You must be joking, right? You come here, trash everything -- and now you try to pay with a novelty cheque?
Are you serious? From your work, I don't know... you can take bribes, I guess..I'm sorry. I don't think cops take bribes.
It was all right..Subdued. I might start letting people up there again... Now, what can I do for you?
This is about your room being locked, isn't it? It's about the electronic lock?.Unpaid bills are no laughing matter to me, sir. I *assure* you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then why are you wasting my time... and yours?
Oh, well, in that case, let me pour you a nice big refreshing Marinella. Do you want that out of a glass or a pineapple?
Right. Well, there you are. Now, was there anything else you wanted?
All yours..Anything else?
You're a *bad* client. You haven't paid your bills yet.
All the locks have an electronic component. They have to be unlocked down here -- with a *master* key before your *guest* key will open the lock.
Great, perfect, I hope you enjoy your freezing cold room with the window you broke *yourself*.
You must be kidding, right?.Yeah, good one, officer. Real funny.
I was merely clearing up the difference. What did you want with it?
An omen?.Whatever...
Fine.
As a matter of fact, you already have the key to your new room -- the trash container, remember? You said you'd give the key back and didn't...
And... I'm sorry about the other night. I'm sorry I told you to sleep in the trash. That was wrong of me.
*You* broke the skua?!
Real mature, man. What exactly were you trying to accomplish?.You do understand you still owe me money, right?
What about what *I* have been through, huh? You're not the goddamn *protagonist* of this story -- I am. This is *my* hostel-cafeteria and I need my money.
It's good you paid before 21.00, or your door would have been locked electronically.
Absolutely not..Fuck you for even implying it. It wasn't me, it wasn't my staff. The establishment will look at it and ascertain what it was.
You know, I was *about* to not mention the clown circus you did out there -- throwing petroleum bombs and whatnot -- but since you feel entitled to nice things, here's the truth: you sucked. It was reckless.
Fine. Okay. The kitchen is closed until 13:00 because the cook is working. You can snoop around after that -- if you must.
Yes, have you got it?
What do you need them for?
What for, Mazov? Are you planning to nationalize my trash container?.whirling.garte_said_maybe_youre_kras_mazov
Okay, the stupid drinks are on the house, Mr. Athlete. I still have to charge you for three nights and the broken window -- that's 100 square.
You can sleep in the trash container outside. I know you don't need a key, since you *tore it open*.
That wasn't so hard, was it? The room is yours for the night. Don't forget you'll need *another* 20 reál tomorrow.
I don't care what you do. Sleep in the trash or pay for a room -- I don't care anymore.
Happy to help, officer. Anything else I can help you with?
No, you *don't*.
No, you *don't*. It's not happening..whirling.garte_said_will_sing_karaoke
Fine, I'll take it off the bill! Sleep in a post-apocalyptic hell-hole if you want to. Just know I won't give you another room.
You know why? Because *unpaid bills* are not funny, when you have to run *four* service establishments..Now. We can talk about a *solution* to this problem.
This isn't a game show. I'm not going to accept it. You owe me cold hard money... I want to see that money in the palm of my hand. Every single cent.
If you run out of money, you die. It's like that for all of us -- me too. That's why I need you to pay me..I'm not an asshole.
Hey..Was there something you needed?
I wish you a quick recovery. Also!.You and your partner are staying here free now. This establishment supports cops. The stay is free -- the drinks are not,.Just felt I needed to specify that.
Anyway, I can't help you there. A lot of women come and go here.
I get it. You were *purposefully* shit. So original. I'm not letting *anyone* up there again -- ever. Now what did you want?
You look surprised? What? It's a great name, I know. Cafeteria managers come up with great names too. It's from a song.
*Hail Holy Queen* by The Etenniers. 'Hail holy queen of the sea,'.'You're whirling in rags -- you're vast and you're sad.
You've heard wrong. And you're *not* putting a dead body into my fridge.
I was... just wondering..If you found pinball machines there...
Then you really don't need a free room, do you?
You don't *have to* give me any money at all. If you *want a room*, yes, you'll need to pay me -- but you don't *have to* just give me money. Giving me money for a room is *your choice.*
The room is yours for the night. Don't forget you'll need *another* 20 reál tomorrow.
