Anything else I can help you with, officer?
Anything else I can help you with, officer?
That is a pretty big problem, yes..Alright. Next time, have Lieutenant Kitsuragi with you.
This is Officer Alice DeMettrie, Precinct 57. How may I assist you?
Who doesn't,.Now, how can I help you in your *investigation*?
Officer?
This is Precinct 57. Can I connect you to someone?
This is Officer Alice DeMettrie, Precinct 57. How may I assist you?
Sir, you're already connected to the 57th Precinct.
Right... Mr. Sunset..Do you have permission to call from the lieutenant's vehicle? Where is he?
I've got Central Jamrock Public Library on the line and I've already introduced you to their librarian. Connecting the call in 2... 1...
Mr. Costeau... if that is your real name, unauthorized use of a police officer's radio is a *major* crime. I will have to alert my colleagues.
Sir, how can I help you with your *investigation*?
This is Precinct 57! Hello, lieutenant, how may I assist you?
Sylvie Malaìika on the line for you, officer.
Officer,.I have Sylvie Malaìika on the line for you.
I'll contact him later for a full report..For now, I'm Officer Alice de Mettrie, how can I help you?
A-ha. Sounds like trouble..Alright. Next time, have Lieutenant Kitsuragi with you.
Sir, you're already connected to the 57th Precinct.
Oh. Do you have permission to call from the lieutenant's vehicle?.Where is he?
Alright. Next time, have Lieutenant Kitsuragi with you.
This is Precinct 57,.How may I assist you?
Why aren't you using your own radio to contact your precinct?
I have *DJ Mesh* on the line. I'll connect you now.
The party has terminated the call. Is there anything else I can do for you, officer?
Mr. Harry, do you have permission to call from the lieutenant's vehicle? Where is he?
What do you mean, officer? I'm not Sylvie.
Now, how can I help you in your *investigation*?
Sorry, officer. Your radio personalities are unavailable, probably until tomorrow. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Just a second, officer...
No problem, officer. Just glad we got it straightened out. I'll contact the ICP database immediately. Call back tomorrow. Hopefully they'll have dug up something useful to your investigation by then.
Officer, as much as I appreciate your efforts to lighten the mood, we both have important work to get back to. Did you have any other *serious* questions?
Officer, I suspect you're just trying to keep me on the line, and I just... don't have time for this. Do you have any other *serious* questions?.plaza.kineema_doyouhaveaboyfriend.plaza.kineema_69_joke
Sure. Call back tomorrow. Hopefully I will have more information for you then.
They couldn't find anything on the full code you gave me. However, the first eight characters were match for a series of paintings by Tobias Pren -- you know, that artist who recently hanged himself?
Does that seem relevant to your investigation?
Sorry, sir. I still haven't heard back from the database people. Try calling again later. Is there anything else I can do for you?
I hope so. Anything else I can do for you?
I'm glad the inquiry was helpful to your investigation, officer. Did you have any other questions?
Sure, officer. What's the number? And the make of the armour, if you know it?
Yes!.That is the most recent name the ICP has been able to connect to the CdP. And the one before it was Downwell. I also have one called Sediment -- but I think that might be a different contractor...
No, they were called *Sediment*. And *Somatosensor*, it seems. All that during the last nine years.
They couldn't find anything on the full code you gave me. However, the first ten characters tracked to a custom-made baby stroller made in Vaasa City ten years ago.
I'm glad the inquiry was helpful to your investigation, officer. Did you have any other questions?
Okay..Does that mean you're ready?
Are you sure that's the right number? Doesn't sound like a serial.
Well, I'll contact the ICP database immediately. Call back tomorrow. Hopefully they'll have dug up something useful to your investigation by then.
Yes. It took some convincing, but I got the mercenary's name and a few biographical details. Are you ready?
Yes. I got the mercenary's name and a few biographical details. Are you ready?.plaza.kineema_serial_convincing
Great. Anything else I can do for you?
Glad to help. Call back tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have more for you then.
Still no word I'm afraid, sir. I know it must be frustrating. Was there anything else you wanted to ask?
Not yet -- but I was able to convince the database people to share private sector information. They promised to get back to me by tomorrow morning. Did you have any other questions?
I'm going to ignore that, officer. Call back tomorrow. Hopefully I will have more information for you then.
If you say so, officer -- of course.
Great. Anything else I could do for you?
It's a garden tool used to press leaves into these... cubes. It's a detail the hospital had -- the only detail in these files. So I thought it would be good for you to know.
It's all I could learn, I'm afraid. That's the serial number you gave me. Anything else I can do for you?
Did you perform a field autopsy?
What about his belongings? Did you examine his clothes?
Can you please describe the body -- age, sex, cause of death?
What about his belongings? Did you examine his clothes?
I see..This is something you should discuss with the Lieutenant Kitsuragi, as you're sharing the case.
That's all for now. Thank you for reporting in. Is there anything else I can do for you?
That's all for now. Thank you for reporting in. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Do you and Lieutenant Kitsuragi want to take the case or should I assign it to someone else?
Good, you have a lead.
A sequence killer..Are you suggesting that this might be connected to the case you're working on?
You just made it up?.I see.
One moment...
Great, I'll give it to your colleagues. You don't have to worry about the case anymore, we'll send our officers to take away the body.
Anything else you need from me?
Anything else you need from me?
It will take just a moment, officer...
Yes, officer, you will be connected in a moment....tc.gottlieb
