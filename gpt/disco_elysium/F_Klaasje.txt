I doubt it..You can't bury that kind of fire. What brought you back to me, Fire Man?
I'm flattered. You told us about the investigation Friday night. Downstairs. At a table full of local kids and dockworkers. You told pretty much everyone. After you showed them your gun...
I always heard you RCM guys were cool..You are.
Welcome to the roof.
You're doing just fine -- after all, your path has led you back to me.
I doubt you will succeed..So, what is this about, officers?
Cool..I've made more money by just *being* than I have with Oranjese lit.
No-no! You said *narcomania*. What kind of word is that?
Have I ever....Have you grown accustomed to your role as a 'police officer'?
Nothing -- if you're no longer there.
The kind of hurry where you can't afford to *not* find your documents -- but don't worry. This has *nothing* to do with your investigation.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you feigned that 'fuck-having' line to get me to say something stupid. Was that so?
You mean that little thing you caught -- when you first came here? On the roof there?
Thank you, but actually -- now that I think about it -- you mentioned sea water? I was worried I'd been too careless with the latch mechanism... The documents were probably,.just washed away...
Anyway -- I thought it would be *funny* to say I didn't do it. Because I knew about your investigation....Does that make me a suspect? I really must stop saying stupid things...
I stand corrected. What brings you back to me -- the coming apocalypse?
No!.Revacholian lit is about how *magnificent and serious* Revachol is. It's about how you have to save the world.
Look..It's dark outside, the dogs are barking and I'm still here, drinking my coffee -- just like I promised.
Ah, I can see that you have, officer.
I'm afraid you can't, officer.
Yes, that must be it. Thank you. I feel better already.
What did you say?
I stand corrected. What brings you back to me -- superstardom?
Of course there are. Look at him....He is The Phoenix. What brings The Phoenix back to me?
Ruby has a gruff charm that inspires loyalty... I do wish you luck in your search, officer.
Thank you for that, officers. Truly.
You kicked it down -- you tell me.
You tell me, officer -- you kicked it down. I've been wondering myself but I'm... light of foot. Not a good door-kicker..whirling.barreddoor_physinst_kicked_once
You kicked it down -- you tell me.
You tell me, officer. I've been trying to open it. In case the Contamination gets to the roof and I have to move on. No luck..whirling.klaasje_contamination_talked_about
A peep hole? You mean like a hole in the wall?
Very funky.
Nice.
That it doesn't *matter* anymore. And that we are *alone* now. It was difficult to tell, the song itself was very quiet and soft, but you sounded like a wounded boar, sir. It was hard to understand what you were singing on top of it.
Hmh....Maybe you don't...
Sure you do, detective...
Ah yes..The night before I saw you in the hallway -- and reminded you you're a police officer.
I hope not..Actually, I *know* that's not the reason. I'm careful about that kind of thing. Not crossing the wires, you know. But that's probably where they got the rape idea.
I think you might have come to the same conclusion last night. At around two o'clock the disco stopped and there was a change of pace.
You know how it is.
Oh, it is..You're still *alive*.
I guess you can say that, yes. A bit. Lovers is such an emotional word. But there was something there. We did enough drugs for there to be.
Yes, you're just one room away..Very personal.
By 'sexually assaulted' you mean 'raped'?
Tell them it's not my style. They'll have to, you know -- if they want to jazz up the charges -- they'll have to get someone more....Rapeable.
A slow, sad song started playing. Like organ music, on repeat. That went on for quite a while. Some of that time you were yelling along to it.
Yes..Never.
Sure you do, you disco animal...
Then you started screaming and trashed the place.
Something *difficult*?.I've been through at least half a dozen difficult things -- which one do you mean?
Hmh....Maybe you *don't* know.
I made it..And I would appreciate it if you didn't tell everyone. In Martinaise they call it *snitching*.
I made the call. And I would appreciate it if you didn't tell everyone. In Martinaise they call it *snitching*.
I think he was in a security detail. He was ex-military. Worked for Wild Pines -- and against the Union. We didn't discuss work much, if you know what I mean. But I understood it was dangerous.
A window was smashed. The tape player probably -- the song stopped -- and furniture too. A real *destructothon*. There was screaming. Then, I think, you passed out.
You don't wanna know.
OO were *huge* where I come from. I was very young then, of course. Like seven. 'Life gets haaard!'.'But we go ooooooon!'
Wow,.Elysium. You don't hear that term often.
I was..It was the night before I saw you in the hallway -- and reminded you you're a police officer.
You have? Not like I do, I imagine.
I think he was in a security detail. He was ex-military. Worked for Wild Pines; against the Union. We didn't discuss work much, if you know what I mean. But I understood it was dangerous.
Ha! Yes. My pleasure..Where did we leave off... hell, let's just take it from the top. You start.
Downstairs..At the bar. He was on some sort of assignment -- a military man, as you probably know. Had a cool, scary scar.
I can't say -- probably not. Sounded like you were flying solo.
Stimulants. Speed also has that effect -- making you drink harder. And then drinking harder makes you do more speed. It's quite the combination. We also had sex.
Oh yes, various artists. Ostentatious Orchestrations prime among them.
Sure you do, apocalypse cop...
He had something to do with the strike. One has been roiling since I got here. Rotten timing....But you probably know all about it.
There was. I think you screamed that you... didn't want to be this type of animal anymore. I may have misheard, but it was sort of memorable.
I hope I've been... you know... helpful. All things considered.
Please, you're alive and *fifty*! I've known people who party so hard they're dead at 14...
What no one does *on your level* is hitting the repeat button, I'll give you that. And *maybe* room-trashing.
Oh yes.
How about we, you know, change the subject to something more light-hearted now?
Not really,.I just think Lely's good enough. But go ahead. You look like you *want* to tell me.
Among many other things, yes. I could have done something. There's always *something* you can do, right?.Ask me something else.
Blue, light blue. They were like....Like little blue galaxies, you know. It was strange, seeing those eyes in his fucked up face...
Good for you.
Ah, another broken thing in a line of broken things..Well, perhaps you'll find one somewhere.
Good for you.
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? It produces a raw, wall-piercing sound.
We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scouring sticks -- you, your first love, Mr. Co Hoi here...
No thank you..I've seen enough of him dead. I can tell you what they *meant* without looking at them.
Yes?
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? It's... uncharacteristically unapologetic when it comes to volume.
Hm? Oh -- I'm guessing your partner should be here too?
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? I'm sure it plays more than OO and the Sad Small Church Band...
He liked the way it *sounded* when he said it. As for Co Hoi...
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? It's... unapologetic when it comes to volume.
You haven't listened to it?.You sure you don't want to hear it before questioning me?
It *is* when you're high. It can be very exciting then -- you have the tools to deal with it. It's not a very nice story to remember when you're sober..A change of topic?
Ah, something happened to it? Another broken thing in a line of broken things. Quite a shame..Well, perhaps you'll find another one.
Uh... no.
It's gonna suck for you later when you have to interrogate me.
Okay, that's cool. Or... if I can just maybe ask you to elaborate on that superstardom a tiny bit?
I have certainly been entertained. Thank you. Whatever you are, you should stick to it. Otherwise...
You're right..There is nothing funny about civilization.
Because you're a police officer, sir.
What was that!? That's not even how *words* are used. What did you say? C'mon, say it again!
I'm sorry..I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
A slow, sad song started playing. Like organ music, on repeat. That went on for quite a while. Some of the time you were yelling along to it.
Yes..Never.
Not as much as you....I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to be glib. I'm sure you're very good at your job.
No....You're a *police* officer, sir.
You sure look like you're from Revachol. Revachol parties.
A window was smashed. The tape player probably -- the song stopped -- and furniture too. A real destructothon. There was screaming. Then, I think, you passed out.
I'm sorry. I was being glib..I'm sure you're a great cop.
Okay, sir, I have to ask: do you really not remember? Just like that....You drank so much you lost your memory?
Unless you've been feeding us a set of well rehearsed lies, you've been here for three days. On *official police business* no less.
In that case, I think I might have a *premonition* for you...
You're one intense cop. Anyone ever tell you that?
That it doesn't *matter* anymore. And that we're *alone* now. It was difficult to tell -- the song itself was very quiet and soft, but you sounded like a wounded boar, sir. It was hard to understand what you were singing on top of it.
So what if you can't pull Grade A pussy anymore? There are other things in life -- more meaningful, more fitting for a man your age. This....This is *fata morgana*. One thing, though...
Officer.
Don't be so harsh on yourself. They let almost anyone be a police officer.
There was. I think you screamed that you... didn't want to be 'this type of animal' anymore. I may have misheard, but it was sort of memorable.
I'm not. Unless *you've* been shitting *us* all this time...
I didn't mean to overwhelm you with information. You seem a bit... lost, officer.
Then you started screaming and trashed the place.
OO were *huge* where I come from. I was very young then, of course. Like seven. 'Life gets haaard!'.'But we go ooooooon!'
Sir, you've been here for three days. On *official police business*, as you put it.
Thank you, sir..I mean that.
I think you might have come to the same conclusion last night. At around two o'clock, the disco stopped, and there was a change of pace.
You've been here for three days. On *official police business*, no less.
No, you see, that's not what you said. You said...
Mere minutes? I should go and prepare then. Thank you, this has been delightful. I hope it does all come crashing down. Otherwise...
Alcohol raises testosterone levels, especially in men,.The levels remain elevated after inebriation ends and the pain begins. You seek comfort. It's only natural.
Sir....You've been here for three days. On *official police business*, no less.
Sir, you've been here for three days. On *official police business*, as you put it.
All right, then. Looks like I should go and prepare for what's to come. And thank you, this has been delightful. I do hope it happens *sooner*. Otherwise...
You're in a hostel, sir.
Oh yes, various artists. Ostentatious Orchestrations prime among them.
God damn right you did, you crazy asshole, you!.What kind of cop *are* you?
I am, yes. Unless you've been feeding us a set of very well rehearsed lies all this time...
First I have to ask: Are you okay, sir?.You look like you're about to throw up... Can I bring you something?
Or maybe you *are* Guillaume le Million? He'd be about your age now... Think about it! One thing, though...
I can see that..I'm glad all this *onward going* has brought you to me.
Are you sure? Love is *terror*...
You've got it bad as it is.
Officer..It's a fine day for questions.
Cool..I've made more money by just *being* than I have with Oranjese lit.
Well-well..It seems I either underestimated you -- or overestimated your hangover, officer.
No, I'm not.
It is.
I did not..Do you think this has something to do with what happened?
You mentioned sea water? I was worried I'd been too careless with the latch. The documents were probably,.just washed away...
Best of luck to you, officers.
I can see that..It suits you.
Not too hard. You told us about the investigation Friday night. Downstairs. At a table full of local kids and dockworkers. You told pretty much everyone. After you showed them your gun...
Yeah... I'm trying not to lie to you here. Stop making it hard.
I really don't know what to tell you...
It's not very cool, but what can you do?
Do you think this is somehow *connected* to me?
That doesn't surprise me... She's careful. But -- before you ask -- I really have no clue where she could've gone.
Talk around the establishment is you have an industrial Sad-spill in there.
Believe me, you don't wanna get into that shit.
Do you think... this is somehow related to... Ruby passing through there?
Thank you -- I've put a lot of time and effort into it,
No-no..You've got it bad as it is.
It's always good to see you.
They couldn't know where I put it. I'm absolutely sure I was not followed. And I've told no one but you...
Now that I think about it -- you mentioned sea water. I was worried I'd been too careless with the latch. The documents were probably,.just washed away...
Sure..Do whatever you need to do.
If I were to lie to you, I would come up with a more *mainstream* name than *Klaasje Amandou*. It's... a weird name.
Cool. You told us about the investigation Friday night. Downstairs. At a table full of local kids and dockworkers. You told pretty much everyone. After you showed them your gun, that is...
Hello, officer..What brings you up here again?
Thank you.
Oh..Well, you know... I'm sad to hear that.
Vredefort, Republic of Oranje.
Right sir. Vredefort, Republic of Oranje. I guess you could say I am an Oranjese *expatriate*..whirling.klaasje_cyclo_oranjese_is_she
Neither do I,.I think it's *alcohol* that makes you feel like that. It must have something to do with partying.
They say so in your tourist brochure -- keep travel documents away from your person when west of the river.
Officer, I like this place, but I don't want to be stuck *wandering* the city like a ghost after being robbed of my travel documents.
Look officers,.I like this place, but I don't want to be stuck *wandering* the city like a ghost after being robbed of my travel documents.
For me it's a mix of *me* with a lack of cleaning services. How about you?
Comes in handy when you've done too many opioids.
It was okay..And it was called Miss *Teen* Oranje '37, actually. You'll be glad to hear the pageant was discontinued.
Thank you for your understanding.
Pretty. Looks like a dried *may bell* -- is that the one you caught? Sam Bo-style?
An unnecessary development, if you ask me..What brings this supposedly *regular* law official back to me?
Oh... Do you think *Ruby* could have gotten in that way? To the *roof*? She could have come up through there!
Huh?.Motherfucker took my Preptide! Looks like you owe me one, officer. I'm talking serious corruption here.
When you have the fewest deviations from the norm. I've been told it's a type of mediocrity that I possess.
Officer. What brings you up here in the rain?
Ruby's certainly passionate, but sentimental -- no, not really... Except maybe about radios -- all kinds of radio technology. So sorry I can't be of any more help to you...
Mhm..I would offer you coffee, but it's garbage -- literally tastes like poison.
I have no idea, officer.
You tell me, officer -- when you've kicked it down. I've been wondering myself but I'm... light of foot. Not a good door-kicker..whirling.barreddoor_physinst_kicked_once
I have no idea, officer.
You tell me, officer. I've been trying to open it. In case the Contamination gets to the roof and I have to move on. No luck..whirling.klaasje_contamination_talked_about
If you say so, officer -- if you say so.
Okay... do you have any way of knowing how *long* it has been there?
Cryptid? Of course. That must be it..Thank you, I feel better already.
Of course, officer. No time to lose..I'm guessing he tried to give you the Doorgunner Megamix, yeah?
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? If it can handle the songs of the coming Apocalypse, I'm sure it can handle this too.
Why would I be scared? Your mother probably never told you this, but girls are *evil*.
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? It produces a stratospheric, bedazzling sound.
He liked the way it *sounded* when he said it. As to Co Hoi...
What *do* I mean?.I have no idea. I don't even know what *you* mean. Love did him in? What does that mean?
Why do you ask?
Sure. You can trust me..I'm guessing he tried to give you the Doorgunner Megamix, yeah?
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? I'm sure it plays more than OO and the Sad Small Church Band...
Running joke. I was gonna say running joke -- and it sounds like you didn't even get the good bits. Lely's punchlines got way, way funkier than that.
Of course, officer. I'll cooperate..I'm guessing he tried to give you the Doorgunner Megamix, yeah?
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? I'm sure it plays more than OO and the Sad Small Church Band...
We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scouring sticks -- you, your first love, Mr. Soldier of the Apocalypse here...
Then you didn't get the Greatest Hits, officer..It's probably for the best... Hm. Hang on...
Then you didn't get the Greatest Hits, officers..It's probably for the best.
It suits you, officer. You should say it more. As to Co Hoi...
Ah, another broken thing in a line of broken things..Well, perhaps you'll find one elsewhere.
As I already told your partner, I didn't actually know his name. I just called him Lely -- it's short for Lelystad, where he came from.
It suits you, officer. You should say it more. As for Co Hoi...
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? It produces stratospheric, bedazzling sound. All night long...
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? I'm sure it plays more than OO and the Sad Small Church Band...
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? I'm sure it plays more than OO and the Sad Small Church Band...
Afraid of what? That tape the Hardie boys recorded? Your mother probably never told you this, but girls are *evil*.
Sure, I can try. What do you need?
Change of topic, perhaps?
I'm quite sure he didn't, officer.
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? It produces a raw, wall-piercing sound.
How much does that toxicology report cost the Police of Revachol? I can do it for *half* of that. Save you some money, make some myself.
May I suggest the stereo system in your room? It goes up to Apocalypse.
May I suggest the stereo system in your partner's room? I'm sure it plays more than OO and the Sad Small Church Band...
...*mayyyybe* you're interpreting them wrong? He enjoyed life, you see. A little too much, if anything. Up to the point where other people had to pay for it.
Thank you.
Ah, something happened to it? Another broken thing in a line of broken things. Quite a shame..Well, perhaps you'll find another one.
That's wonderful to hear.
That's an odd thing to say to yourself, officer.
She said she'd take care of this. It's what she does, you know. Take care of things. I helped her get the body to the bathroom -- we used a belt to pull him up under the shower. To keep him upright.
About twenty, yes. Ruby explained it would make the blood... you know what it does.
I know what this sounds like. That's why I didn't want to tell you before..But she *knew* what had happened -- when I came downstairs.
Thank you..Thank you. You won't regret it.
How do you deal with anything? It's all just....How do *you* do it?
I promise I will be right here all the time -- nights too. I'll help you *any* way I can in this investigation and I *will* be at Station 41 in six weeks..I promise.
As to who hired me for the job -- I don't know. But *they're* after me too. Along with Looskap, and their friends in the MI..Once you're done in the competitive intelligence circuit, you don't have allies. You're radioactive.
I've said I'm sorry. What more do you want me to say? I did my best not to lie. It didn't always work.
Like what?
You answer to the Coalition Government -- and, by extension, the *Moralintern*...
I don't..How do *you* live with yourself?
But I know the *time* of the call too!.I know I have not been 100% truthful with you, officers. But I *am* now.
No..No -- why would she do that to herself? No, I just remembered you told me about it, and...
I thought officers in Revachol would be more enlightened about these things..Especially since you've admitted to taking drugs yourself.
He kept throwing stones at him for *three days*. I could hear the *thud*, *thud*....So I called you. I hope with all my heart it's not the last thing I do in Revachol.
I don't....How did you know that?
There you have it..The way of the warrior.
I think you meant to say *bitch* there.
With a bigger company -- the kind you really, really don't fuck with. I took their ledgers -- two decades' worth of accounting.
I'm not lying to you...
I'm not lying to you....whirling.klaasje_threw_ziggy_away
The work I did -- they don't just send you in with no training. Corporate security is a thing. But I'm not a trained Sam Bo fighter, I've never needed it outside the gym.
Last week. Angus and Titus's brother -- I think he's called Tibbs -- took care of it..I told you I'm a horrible girl. I told you things break around me.
A little. I was flattered, you know. But then I had to let her off and it was *not* easy. I came to regret being friendly with her..We maybe kissed. Nothing more.
Yes. She's been up here many times. She used to come to drink on the roof when...
I know..For what it's worth, I'm sorry. For all of this, for wasting your time.
You share a database with them. You send people to their courts.
Just business -- but *bad* business for some people in the Moralintern. If I show up in your records, officer, they will find me. They will...
If there's one thing I know it's that you'll get *nothing* from Looskap. They don't fuck things like this up.
I can give you the *time* too, it was late. After midnight. 12:20..I know I have not been 100% truthful with you. But I *am* now.
You said there was a secret route there, right?
You log your work *every week*. It's *all* transmitted to COMINSUR. I couldn't just beg you not to enter my name... So I lied.
I did not kill him to defend myself from rape,.I told you before. That wasn't what happened.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
You're welcome to it. It's in the reeds northwest of here, past a broken sewage pipe. Right near the waterline.
They will kill me, officer. If you file my name, take me in for questioning, enter me into the Moralintern mill...
You share a database with them. You send people to their courts.
Wow. Someone has their testosterone cranked up to neolithic. Let me just forcefully re-rail this talk for you, okay? Are you okay with that? Here we go...
You can call me whatever you want.
You have those *station calls*, right? Where I have to show up at the station or I'll become a fugitive. You can write me one. You don't have to take me in right now... I promise I won't go out anymore, at night. I'll be right here.
Don't. The world can change. It has changed before...
You're right... there's more.
I....One of them killed themselves. Because of me.
I don't ask you to, lieutenant. If there's one thing I know it's that you'll get *nothing* from there.
I knew there was a chance you'd get them to tell you. It's what you do. You're the police.
A lot of people got hurt,.But that's just more of my shit you shouldn't have to deal with. You're solving a murder.
You didn't.
They will kill me, sir. If you file my name -- take me in for questioning -- enter me into the Moralintern mill...
Ruby. You know. The leader.
You're welcome to it. It's in the reeds northwest of here, past a broken sewage pipe. Right near the waterline.
I sense you're being sarcastic. Okay. The thing is -- you're on the payroll of the Moralist International...
It is..They're after me. And they have friends in the Moralintern -- some *are* Moralintern. If I show up in your records, officer, they will find me. They will...
I *did*..What is this? I called your *desk*, or whatever it is. The numbers are all over town: 'Call 8-100-2 for Emergencies'.
Who was he? A boy. A student. It was a good thing and I destroyed him.
He was a writer, he made Oranjese lit -- and I destroyed him..whirling.klaasje_oranjese_lit_talked_about
I think I *know* who did it. Who shot Lely... I can tell you. I can help you.
I think I know who did it -- I know who shot Lely. You know it wasn't me, why would I do it? I have no motive....whirling.klaasje_suspect
I know what it sounds like. That's why I didn't want to tell you before..But she *knew* what had happened -- when I came downstairs.
She could have had access to the roof..You've noticed that door there, right? Maybe it leads downstairs?
I'm sorry for wasting your time. I should have known you'd... that you'd find out.
I have people after me. And they have friends in the Moralintern -- some *are* Moralintern. If I show up in your records, officer, they will find me. They will...
You have to understand -- the people around here... No one was making the call, and he kept rotting. And then they picked his clothes off. And that little fucker threw stones at him...
You've been through there, right? I saw you come out..It leads downstairs.
It was a mistake..I'm sorry for wasting your time.
I thought Revachol would be more enlightened about this..Especially since you've taken them yourself.
I thought you Revachol people would be more enlightened on this....I'm sorry, officer. I'm under some stress here.
I know you can do that -- just let me come in on my own. In two months. Or maybe even one month. That's all I need...
The job was Loosduin County Savings Bank -- they sound small but they're part of the Looskap conglomerate. That was the second job. The first was some printer company. You wouldn't know them.
Yes, but... How did you know that?
Thank you.
That's cool...
You've been trying to kick that door down, right?.Maybe it leads downstairs?
Let's say you were twenty-something. Twenty five. A good disco age. Twenty five plus nineteen is forty four. I'm gonna say you're 44.
Sure. Age is just a number, you know..It's all in your *head*.
Sure, yeah. And if you're not -- age is just a number anyway.
That's pretty much it, but... Age is just a number anyway, you know.
Huh?.How old do I think you are?
Sure he is. You know, age is just a number.
Yeah. I have a university degree, you know.
Sure he is. You know. Age is just a number.
I don't know... 40? I was like 9 when OO peaked. That was, what? Nineteen years ago? I liked them when I was 9. You couldn't have liked it when you were 40...
Look -- at the end of the day, age is just a number, you know.
Sure he is. You know, age is just a number.
Don't you know, sir? I thought you were from around here. You look like *Mr. Revachol*.
Silence, officer. Wouldn't have thought you the silent type... What were we talking about?
As I said -- there's talk. In the competitive intelligence crowd. A lot of people, like me, who need... a new colour on the map. It's all blue, you see. And that blue doesn't like us.
You mean here -- in Martinaise?
So, officer...
Soon. But it's been *soon* for almost half a century now, so don't hold your breath.
Yeah....I guess it is.
Where the walls are still porous and you can slip through. This is just... something to get me through the night you know. A little *espérance*.
